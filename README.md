## Configuration

The plugin can be configured through Chrome's extension storage:

- `ucpEnabled`: Enable/disable the plugin (default: true)
- `autoOpen`: Automatically open UCP on page load (default: false)
- `ucpUrl`: UCP server URL (default: https://ucdemo.voicemeetme.com/ucp/login)

## API Events

The plugin listens for and handles these UCP message types:

- `UCP_INCOMING_CALL`: Incoming call notification
- `UCP_SESSION_CREATED`: UCP session establishment
- `UCP_FULLSCREEN_CHANGE`: Fullscreen mode toggle
- `UCP_CALL_ENDED`: Call termination

## Development

### Testing Locally
1. Load the extension in developer mode
2. Navigate to a supported domain (e.g., localhost or zoho.com)
3. The UCP interface should automatically inject
4. Use browser developer tools to monitor console logs

### Debugging
- Check the extension's background script logs in `chrome://extensions/`
- Monitor content script logs in the page's developer console
- Use `window.ucpPlugin` and `window.ucpContentScript` for debugging

### Customization
- Modify `ucp-plugin.css` for styling changes
- Update `ucp-plugin.js` for functionality changes
- Edit `manifest.json` to add new permissions or domains

## Security

- All UCP messages are validated for origin security
- Content is sandboxed within iframes
- Only trusted domains are allowed for injection
- Secure message passing between extension components

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 88+ (Manifest V3 support required)
- Edge 88+ (Chromium-based)
- Other Chromium-based browsers with Manifest V3 support

## Troubleshooting

### UCP Not Appearing
1. Check that you're on a supported domain
2. Verify the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
3. Check browser console for error messages
4. Try refreshing the page

### Call Notifications Not Working
1. Ensure browser notifications are enabled
2. Check that the UCP URL is accessible
3. Verify iframe permissions in browser settings
4. Check network connectivity to UCP servers

### Performance Issues
1. Close unused UCP windows
2. Check for JavaScript errors in console
3. Disable other conflicting extensions
4. Clear browser cache and reload
